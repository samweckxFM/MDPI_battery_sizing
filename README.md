# MDPI_battery_sizing
This repository contains the data of the publication (Evaluating Hybridization Potential Using Load Profile Metrics: A Rule-of-Thumb Approach) submitted to mdpi batteries
This folder contains the 10000 load profiles for which the sizing took place. Each load profile contains a time vector t and a load vector P [W]
The results of the optimization are present in sizing_logs
Optimizing a HESS for a given load profile can be done on https://battery.flandersmake.be/
